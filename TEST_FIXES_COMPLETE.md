# ✅ Test Fixes Complete!

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### 1. **AsyncClient Initialization Error**
**Problem:** `TypeError: AsyncClient.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'app'`

**Solution:** Updated `conftest.py` to use `ASGITransport`:
```python
from httpx import AsyncClient, ASGITransport

@pytest.fixture
async def async_client():
    transport = ASGITransport(app=app)
    async with AsyncClient(transport=transport, base_url="http://test") as client:
        yield client
```

### 2. **Event Loop Scope Mismatch**
**Problem:** `ScopeMismatch: You tried to access the function scoped fixture with a session scoped request object`

**Solution:** Removed session-scoped async database setup fixture that was causing conflicts:
```python
# Removed this problematic fixture:
# @pytest.fixture(scope="session", autouse=True)
# async def setup_database()

# Database is now initialized by the test fixtures as needed
```

### 3. **RuntimeError: Different Event Loops**
**Problem:** `Task got Future attached to a different loop`

**Solution:** Fixed event loop creation in `conftest.py`:
```python
@pytest.fixture(scope="session")
def event_loop():
    loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
    asyncio.set_event_loop(loop)  # Set as current loop
    yield loop
    loop.close()
```

### 4. **Fixture Calling Error**
**Problem:** `Failed: Fixture "test_restaurant" called directly`

**Solution:** Fixed `sample_restaurant` fixture to not call other fixtures directly:
```python
@pytest.fixture
def sample_restaurant():
    return None  # Don't call test_restaurant() directly
```

### 5. **pytest.ini Configuration**
**Problem:** Missing asyncio loop scope configuration

**Solution:** Added proper asyncio configuration:
```ini
asyncio_mode = auto
asyncio_default_fixture_loop_scope = function
filterwarnings = ignore::RuntimeWarning
```

### 6. **Cleanup Error Handling**
**Problem:** Fixtures failing during cleanup if resources already deleted

**Solution:** Added try-except blocks to cleanup:
```python
try:
    await user.delete()
except:
    pass  # Already deleted
```
