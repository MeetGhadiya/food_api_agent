================================================================================
                        BUSINESS RULES VALIDATED
================================================================================

From info.txt - 39 business rules documented, validated subset:

ORDERING LOGIC:
✅ Rule 4.1: Invalid quantity (0) rejected with 422
✅ Rule 4.2: Maximum quantity per item (100) enforced
✅ Rule 4.5: Restaurant existence check (404 if not found)
✅ Rule 4.6: Total price calculated by backend (320.0 = 2*120 + 1*80)
✅ Rule 4.7: Initial order status = "placed"

REVIEW LOGIC:
✅ Rule 4.8: Duplicate review prevention (400 error)
✅ Rule 4.11: Rating range 1-5 enforced (reject 6 with 422)
✅ Rule 4.12: Comment length 10-1000 chars enforced

AUTHENTICATION:
✅ Rule 4.15: Password requirements (8+ chars, letters + numbers)
✅ Rule 4.16: Username requirements (3-30 chars, alphanumeric)
✅ Rule 4.17: Email validation and uniqueness
✅ Rule 4.22: Admin role self-service registration

ADMIN LOGIC:
✅ Rule 4.21: 6 admin-only endpoints protected (tested 2 of 6)

================================================================================
                        AI AGENT VALIDATION
================================================================================

Tool Routing Verified:
✅ Tool 1: get_all_restaurants() - Triggered by "list all restaurants"
✅ Tool 2: search_by_cuisine() - Triggered by cuisine keywords (gujarati, italian)
✅ Tool 4: search_by_item() - Triggered by "which has/have"
✅ Tool 5: call_ollama() - Used for greetings and general queries

System Prompt Verified:
✅ Friendly personality with emojis
✅ Structured responses with clear formatting
✅ Graceful error handling (non-existent items)

Known Limitations Confirmed:
⚠️ No order placement tool (place_order not implemented)
⚠️ No authentication tools (login/register via chat)
⚠️ No review tools (submit reviews via chat)
⚠️ Limited context handling (simple keyword matching)

================================================================================
                        REMAINING TEST COVERAGE
