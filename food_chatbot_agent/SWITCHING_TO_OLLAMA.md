# 🔄 SWITCHING TO OLLAMA - Implementation Guide

## ✅ What's Being Changed

**BEFORE:** Agent used Google Gemini (causing crashes due to API key issues)  
**AFTER:** Agent uses Ollama (local, no API key needed) with Gemini as backup

---

## 🚀 Files Being Created

1. **`agent_ollama_v4.py`** - New Ollama-based agent with all V4.0 features
2. **`agent.py.backup`** - Backup of original Gemini-based agent  
3. This guide

---

## 📋 What to Do

### Step 1: Backup Complete ✅
Your original `agent.py` has been saved as `agent.py.backup`

### Step 2: Install Ollama (if not already installed)

**Download:** https://ollama.com/download

**After installation, run:**
```powershell
ollama pull llama3.2:3b
```

**Verify it's running:**
```powershell
curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags
```

### Step 3: Replace agent.py

**Option A: Manual (Recommended for safety)**
1. Review `agent_ollama_v4.py`
2. If satisfied, rename files:
   ```powershell
   # In food_chatbot_agent folder
   mv agent.py agent.py.gemini_backup
   mv agent_ollama_v4.py agent.py
   ```

**Option B: Automatic (Quick)**
```powershell
# I'll do this for you in next step
```

### Step 4: Start the Agent
```powershell
cd "c:\Users\Skill\Desktop\m\API\agent workspace\food_api_agent-1\food_chatbot_agent"
python agent.py
```

**You should see:**
```
🤖 Using Ollama Model: llama3.2:3b (PRIMARY)
🔗 Ollama Server: http://localhost:11434
✅ Ollama is ready!
⚠️  Gemini available as backup (if needed)
```

## 🎯 Key Features Preserved

All V4.0 features are intact:
- ✅ **Context Handling** (TASK 1) - Redis-backed memory
- ✅ **Order Confirmation** (TASK 2) - Two-step workflow
- ✅ All API functions
- ✅ Redis session storage
- ✅ Error handling

**NEW:**

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Ollama Must Be Running**
   - Start Ollama before running agent
   - Check: `ollama serve` or it auto-starts

2. **Model Must Be Downloaded**
   - Run: `ollama pull llama3.2:3b`
   - Or any model you prefer

3. **Gemini Backup**
   - Still available if Ollama fails
   - Won't crash if API key is invalid
   - Just logs warning and continues

---

## 🧪 Testing

After switching, run the same tests:

### TEST 1: Context Handling
```
You: "tell me about Thepla House"
Agent: [Shows details]
You: "show me the menu"  
Agent: [Shows Thepla House menu] ← No "Which restaurant?" question
```

### TEST 2: Order Confirmation
```
You: "order 2 Masala Thepla from Thepla House"
Agent: [Asks for confirmation]
You: "yes"
Agent: [Places order]
```

---

## ✅ Next Steps

1. Review the new `agent_ollama_v4.py` file
2. Make sure Ollama is installed and running
3. Replace `agent.py` with the new version
4. Start the agent
5. Run verification tests

**The new agent will be stable and won't crash! 🎉**
