75-89%   → GOOD ⚠️
50-74%   → NEEDS IMPROVEMENT ⚠️
< 50%    → CRITICAL ❌
```

## 🔍 Key Tests to Watch

### Test 3.2b - Context Handling
**Tests if agent remembers previous restaurant:**
```
User: "tell me about Swati Snacks"
Agent: [shows details]
User: "show me the menu"
Agent: Should show Swati Snacks menu (NOT search for "The Menu" restaurant)
```

**Known Issue:** Agent may fail this due to simple keyword matching

### Test 4.2 - Order Confirmation
**Tests if agent asks for confirmation:**
```
User: "order 2 Masala Thepla from Swati Snacks"
Agent: Should ask "Confirm: 2x Masala Thepla. Is this correct?"
```

**Known Issue:** Confirmation gate not implemented yet (TASK 2)

### Test 8.x - Multi-turn Conversations
**Tests conversation memory:**
- 8.1b: "tell me more about the first one" (should remember restaurant list)
- 8.2b: "what else do they have?" (should remember current restaurant)

**Known Issue:** Limited context handling

## 🐛 Expected Failures

Based on known limitations, these tests may fail:

| Test ID | Test Name | Expected Issue |
|---------|-----------|----------------|
| 3.2b | Context Menu | May search for "The Menu" restaurant |
| 4.2 | Order Confirmation | No confirmation gate |
| 8.1b | Multi-turn Context | May lose conversation context |
| 8.2b | Multi-turn Menu | May ask "which restaurant?" |

## 🔧 Customization

### Add New Test
```python
run_test(
    "13.1",                          # Test ID
    "Test Description",              # What it tests
    "user message",                  # Message to send
    ["expected", "keywords"],        # Must contain these
    forbidden_keywords=["bad"],      # Must NOT contain these
    context_description="Custom"     # Optional description
)
```

### Reset Conversation History
```python
reset_session()  # Clears all previous messages
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Run the Tests**
   ```bash
   python TESTING/run_comprehensive_tests.py
   ```

2. **Review Results**
   - Check which tests passed/failed
