## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: You Must Still Do This

Even though the repository is clean, the **exposed credentials are still active** and need to be rotated:

### 1. Revoke Google API Keys (5 min) 🔴
- Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
- Delete old API keys (created around October 10-15, 2025)
- Keep your current production key safe

### 2. Rotate MongoDB Password (5 min) 🔴  
- Go to: https://cloud.mongodb.com
- Database Access → foodapi_user → Edit → Edit Password
- Generate new secure password
- Copy and save it

### 3. Update Local .env Files (2 min)
- `food_api/.env` - Add new MongoDB password
- `food_chatbot_agent/.env` - Add your current API key

---

## 🎯 What Happens Next

1. **Complete the 3 actions above** (~12 minutes)
2. **Wait 5-10 minutes** for GitHub/GitGuardian to re-scan
3. **GitGuardian alert will auto-resolve** when it detects no secrets
4. **Your PR will be ready to merge!** 🎉

## 💡 Prevention Tips

Going forward:

- ✅ Use .env.example for templates (already created)
- ✅ Rotate credentials every 90 days
- ✅ Enable GitHub secret scanning push protection
- ✅ Use placeholder values in all documentation
