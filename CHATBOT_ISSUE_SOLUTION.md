# Chatbot Issue Resolution

## Problem
The chatbot displays the error: **"I am sorry, I am having trouble connecting to the restaurant service right now. Please try again in sometime."**

## Root Cause
The Google Gemini API key in the `.env` file is **invalid or expired**.

Error from API:
```
404 models/gemini-pro is not found for API version v1beta, or is not supported for generateContent.
```

## Current API Key
- Location: `food_api_agent/.env`
- Key: `KEY_REMOVED_FOR_SECURITY`
- Status: ❌ **INVALID/EXPIRED**

## Solution

### Step 1: Get a New API Key
1. Visit: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey (or https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Copy the new API key

### Step 2: Update the .env File
1. Open: `food_api_agent/.env`
2. Replace the old API key with the new one:
   ```
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_NEW_API_KEY_HERE
   ```
3. Save the file

### Step 3: Restart Services
Run the batch script to restart all services:
```batch
start_all_services.bat
```

OR manually restart:
```powershell
# Kill existing processes
taskkill /F /IM python.exe

# Start FastAPI
cd food_api
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Start Flask Agent (in new terminal)
python food_api_agent/web_agent.py

# Start React Frontend (in new terminal)
cd chatbot_frontend
npm run dev
```

## Verification

After updating the API key, test it:
```powershell
cd food_api_agent
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python check_api_key.py
```

You should see:
```
✅ API key configured
✅ API working! Response: [some text]
```

## What's Working

✅ FastAPI Backend (localhost:8000)
✅ Restaurant Data (7 restaurants with grouped items)
✅ User Authentication 
✅ Order Placement
✅ React Frontend (localhost:5173)
✅ Flask Agent Server (localhost:5000)

## What's NOT Working

❌ Gemini AI Integration (invalid API key)

## Once Fixed

The chatbot will be able to:
- List all restaurants with their menu items
- Show restaurant details
- Help users browse and select items
- Place orders (with login)
- Answer natural language queries about food

## Note

The restaurant model refactoring is complete:
- ✅ Items are grouped under single restaurant entries
- ✅ "cuisine" renamed to "item_name"
- ✅ Database migrated and populated with proper data
- ✅ Backend endpoints updated
- ✅ All services configured correctly

**The ONLY remaining issue is the invalid Gemini API key!**
