# 🧪 Quick Test Guide - Final Polish

## Pre-Test Setup

### 1. Restart All Services

Since we made code changes, restart services to load new code:

#### Stop Current Services
- Press `Ctrl+C` in each terminal window

#### Start Services in Order

**Terminal 1: FastAPI Backend**
```powershell
cd "c:\Users\Skill\Desktop\m\API\agent workspace\food_api_agent-1\food_api"
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

**Terminal 2: Flask AI Agent**
```powershell
cd "c:\Users\Skill\Desktop\m\API\agent workspace\food_api_agent-1\food_chatbot_agent"
python agent.py
```

**Terminal 3: React Frontend**
```powershell
cd "c:\Users\Skill\Desktop\m\API\agent workspace\food_api_agent-1\chatbot_frontend"
npm run dev
```

**Wait:** 10-15 seconds for all services to fully start
