# 🎉 Context Handling Fix - Implementation Complete

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Status:** ✅ CODE IMPLEMENTED, TESTING IN PROGRESS

---

## 📋 What Was Implemented

### 1. Session Context Storage
**File:** `food_chatbot_agent/agent_simple.py`

**Added:**
```python
session_context = {}  # New: Stores context like last_restaurant, pending_order

def save_context(user_id, key, value):
    """Save context information for a user session"""
    if user_id not in session_context:
        session_context[user_id] = {}
    session_context[user_id][key] = value
    print(f"🔍 CONTEXT SAVED: {user_id} -> {key} = {value}")

def get_context(user_id, key, default=None):
    """Retrieve context information from user session"""
    if user_id not in session_context:
        return default
    value = session_context[user_id].get(key, default)
    print(f"🔍 CONTEXT RETRIEVED: {user_id} -> {key} = {value}")
    return value

def clear_context(user_id, key=None):
    """Clear specific context key or entire context for user"""
    if user_id in session_context:
        if key:
            session_context[user_id].pop(key, None)
        else:
            del session_context[user_id]
```

**Purpose:** Track user-specific context across conversation turns

---

### 2. Restaurant Context Tracking
**Modified Function:** `get_restaurant_by_name()`

**Changes:**
```python
def get_restaurant_by_name(name, user_id=None):
    # ... existing code ...
    
    # 🔥 NEW: Save context when restaurant is viewed
    if user_id:
        save_context(user_id, 'last_restaurant', restaurant_name)
        save_context(user_id, 'last_restaurant_data', r)
```

**Impact:** Every time a user views a restaurant, we remember it

---

### 3. Enhanced System Instruction
**Updated:** `SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION` with context awareness rules

**Added:**
```python
CONTEXT AWARENESS RULES:
- Before processing a query, check if there's a "last_restaurant" in the session context
- If the user's query is vague (e.g., "show the menu", "what do they have", "tell me more"), 
  assume they are referring to the last_restaurant
- Vague queries include: "menu", "the menu", "what else", "more info", "details", "items"
```

**Purpose:** Guide agent to use context for vague queries

---

### 4. Context-Aware Tool Routing
**Modified:** Main chat logic in `@app.route('/chat')`

**Key Changes:**
```python
# Define vague menu queries
vague_menu_queries = ["show me the menu", "the menu", "what's on the menu", 
                     "menu please", "show menu", "what do they have",
                     "what else do they have", "tell me more", "more info",
                     "what items", "show items"]

is_vague_query = any(vague in message_lower for vague in vague_menu_queries)

# When "menu" is mentioned...
elif "menu" in message_lower or is_vague_query:
    # 🔥 Check if there's a last_restaurant in context
    last_restaurant = get_context(user_id, 'last_restaurant')
    
    if last_restaurant:
        # Use the last restaurant from context
        print(f"🔥 CONTEXT HIT: Using last_restaurant = {last_restaurant}")
        response_text = get_restaurant_by_name(last_restaurant, user_id)
    else:
        # No context available
        response_text = "I'd be happy to show you a menu! Which restaurant would you like to know about?"
```

**Before Fix:**
```
User: "tell me about Swati Snacks"
Agent: [shows details]
User: "show me the menu"
Agent: ❌ Searches for restaurant named "The Menu"
```

**After Fix:**
```
User: "tell me about Swati Snacks"
Agent: [shows details, saves context]
User: "show me the menu"
Agent: ✅ Shows Swati Snacks menu (uses context)
```

---

### 5. Session Clear Enhancement
**Modified:** `/clear-session` endpoint

**Changes:**
```python
@app.route('/clear-session', methods=['POST'])
def clear_session():
    """Clear chat session and context"""
    data = request.get_json()
    if data:
        user_id = data.get('user_id', 'guest')
        if user_id in chat_sessions:
            del chat_sessions[user_id]
        if user_id in session_context:  # NEW
            del session_context[user_id]  # NEW
    return jsonify({"message": "Session and context cleared"})
```

**Purpose:** Properly clean up both history and context

---

## 🎯 Tests Expected to Pass

### Test 3.2b - Context Menu Request
**Before:**
- Status: ❌ EXPECTED FAIL
- Issue: Agent searches for "The Menu" restaurant

**After:**
- Status: ✅ SHOULD PASS
- Behavior: Agent uses last_restaurant from context

### Test 8.1b - Multi-turn: "tell me more about the first one"
**Before:**
- Status: ❌ EXPECTED FAIL
- Issue: Agent doesn't track which was "the first one"

**After:**
- Status: ⚠️ PARTIAL IMPROVEMENT
- Note: Would need list context tracking (future enhancement)

### Test 8.2b - Multi-turn: "what else do they have?"
**Before:**
- Status: ❌ EXPECTED FAIL
- Issue: Agent asks "which restaurant?"

**After:**
- Status: ✅ SHOULD PASS
- Behavior: Agent uses last_restaurant from context

---

## 📊 Expected Impact

### Success Rate Improvement
| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Test 3.2b | ❌ FAIL | ✅ PASS | +1 test |
| Test 8.2b | ❌ FAIL | ✅ PASS | +1 test |
| Test 8.1b | ❌ FAIL | ⚠️ PARTIAL | +0.5 test |
| Overall Rate | 75-85% | 80-90% | +5-10% |

### User Experience Improvement
- ✅ Natural multi-turn conversations
- ✅ Users don't need to repeat restaurant names
- ✅ Context-aware responses feel more intelligent
- ✅ Reduced friction in conversation flow

---

## 🧪 Test Script Created

**File:** `test_context_fix.py`

**Tests:**
1. **Basic Context Test**
   - Ask about Swati Snacks
   - Then ask "show me the menu" (vague)
   - Verify agent uses context

2. **Advanced Context Switching**
   - Ask about Agashiye
   - Then ask "what else do they have?"
   - Verify agent maintains context

**Usage:**
```powershell
python test_context_fix.py
```

---

## 🔧 Next Steps

### Immediate (Today)
1. ✅ Code implemented
2. ⏳ Agent restart needed (crashed during test)
3. ⏳ Run full context tests
4. ⏳ Verify Test 3.2b passes
5. ⏳ Update test suite results

### Short Term (This Week)
1. Add list context tracking for "first one", "second one"
2. Track multiple entities (restaurant + item)
3. Add context expiry (clear after N turns of inactivity)

### Medium Term (Next Sprint)
1. Implement order confirmation (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
2. Complete tool implementation (LOW PRIORITY)
3. Run full 40+ test suite
4. Achieve 90%+ pass rate

## 📝 Technical Details

### Data Structure
```python
session_context = {
    "user_123": {
        "last_restaurant": "Swati Snacks",
        "last_restaurant_data": {...},
        "last_item": "Bhel Puri",
        "pending_order": None  # For future order confirmation
    }
}
```

### Context Keys Used
- `last_restaurant`: Name of last viewed restaurant
- `last_restaurant_data`: Full restaurant object (menu, location, etc.)

### Future Context Keys
- `last_list`: For "first one", "second one" references
- `pending_order`: For order confirmation flow
- `last_item`: For item-specific queries

---

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Simple Dict Storage:** In-memory dict works great for prototype
2. **Debug Logging:** Print statements help track context flow
3. **Vague Query Detection:** List of common phrases catches most cases

### What Could Be Better
1. **Redis Integration:** For production, use Redis for persistence
2. **Context Expiry:** Add TTL to prevent stale context
3. **Entity Resolution:** More sophisticated NLP for "it", "they", "that one"

---

## 🏆 Success Criteria

### Definition of Done
- ✅ Code implemented
- ⏳ Agent runs without crashes
- ⏳ Test 3.2b passes
- ⏳ Test 8.2b passes
- ⏳ Context persists across turns
- ⏳ No regression in other tests

### Acceptance Test
```
User: "tell me about Swati Snacks"
Agent: [shows menu]
User: "show me the menu"
Agent: [shows Swati Snacks menu again, NOT "The Menu" restaurant]
Result: ✅ PASS
```

---

## 🚀 Ready for Next Priority

Once context handling is verified:
1. ✅ Move to MEDIUM PRIORITY: Order Confirmation
2. Implement pending_order context
3. Add confirmation prompts
4. Wait for "yes/no" before order placement
