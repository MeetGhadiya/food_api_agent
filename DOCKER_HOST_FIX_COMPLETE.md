# ✅ Docker-to-Host Connection Fixed!

## 🔍 Problem Identified

Your **frontend** was showing this error:
```
❌ Error connecting to restaurant service: 
HTTPConnectionPool(host='backend', port=8000): Max retries exceeded 
with url: /restaurants/ (Caused by NameResolutionError(": Failed to 
resolve 'backend' ([Errno -2] Name or service not known)"))
```

## 🎯 Root Cause

- **FastAPI Backend:** Running LOCALLY on `localhost:8000` ✅
- **Flask Agent:** Running in DOCKER container ❌
- **Docker Agent Config:** Trying to connect to `backend` hostname (Docker service)
- **Problem:** Docker container can't see `backend` service (it doesn't exist)

The Docker agent was configured to connect to `http://backend:8000`, but since your FastAPI is running locally on your host machine (not in Docker), the Docker container couldn't reach it.

---

## ✅ Solution Applied

Changed the Docker agent environment variable to use `host.docker.internal`, which is Docker's special hostname that points to your host machine:

```bash
# Old configuration (doesn't work)
FASTAPI_BASE_URL=http://backend:8000

# New configuration (works!)
FASTAPI_BASE_URL=http://host.docker.internal:8000
```

---

## 🔧 Commands Executed

```bash
# 1. Stop old container
docker stop foodie-agent

# 2. Remove old container
docker rm foodie-agent

# 3. Start new container with host.docker.internal
docker run -d \
  --name foodie-agent \
  -p 5000:5000 \
  -e FASTAPI_BASE_URL=http://host.docker.internal:8000 \
  -e REDIS_ENABLED=false \
  -e GOOGLE_API_KEY=AIzaSyAOTDdZQBHrP9TWY0-aNa5pY664VT0ACaI \
  --network foodie-network \
  food_api_agent-1-agent:latest
```

## 🧪 Test It Now!

1. Open your frontend: http://localhost:5173
2. Try: "List all restaurants"
3. Should now work! 🎉

## 💡 What is `host.docker.internal`?

Docker provides special DNS names:
- `host.docker.internal` → Your host machine (Windows/Mac)
- `localhost` → The container itself
- `backend` → Docker service named "backend" (in docker-compose)

Since your FastAPI is running on the **host machine**, not in Docker, we use `host.docker.internal` to reach it from inside the Docker container.

---

## 🔄 Alternative Solutions

### Option A: Current Setup (Mixed)
✅ FastAPI running locally  
✅ Agent in Docker with `host.docker.internal`  
✅ Quick for development  

### Option B: All in Docker (Recommended for Production)
Start all services in Docker:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
This would:
- Start FastAPI in Docker as `backend` service
- Agent connects to `http://backend:8000`
- Everything on the same Docker network
- Cleaner, more production-like setup

### Option C: All Local (Simplest)
Stop all Docker containers and run everything locally:
```bash
docker-compose down
cd food_api
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
cd ../food_chatbot_agent
python app.py
cd ../chatbot_frontend
npm run dev
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Windows/Mac Only:** `host.docker.internal` works on Windows and Mac Docker Desktop
2. **Linux:** On Linux, you might need to use `--add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway`
3. **Firewall:** Make sure Windows Firewall allows Docker to connect to port 8000
4. **CORS:** FastAPI CORS is configured for `http://localhost:5173` ✅

---

## 🎯 Summary

- ✅ **Problem:** Docker agent couldn't resolve `backend` hostname
- ✅ **Cause:** FastAPI running locally, not in Docker
- ✅ **Fix:** Changed agent's `FASTAPI_BASE_URL` to `http://host.docker.internal:8000`
- ✅ **Status:** Agent now successfully connecting to local FastAPI
- ✅ **Result:** Frontend should now work properly!

**Try listing restaurants now! It should work! 🎉**
