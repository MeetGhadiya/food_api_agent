## 🔍 Debug Checklist

### If you see an EMPTY response:

**Example**: "Sure! Here's the list! 🎉\n\n" (but no restaurants listed)

**Check the browser console**:
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for the response JSON:
   ```javascript
   Response: {"response": "Sure! Here's the list! 🎉\n\n"}
   ```

**If you see this**: The bug is back! Report immediately with console logs.

---

### If you see DUPLICATE responses:

**Example**: Two separate messages from the bot for one query

**Check**:
- Did you close and reopen the chatbot?
- Is the frontend cache cleared?
- Check browser console for multiple API calls

---

### If you see "KeyError: 'name'" or other errors:

**Check**:
- Is the FastAPI backend running? (http://localhost:8000)
- Are all 7 restaurants in the database with cuisine fields?
- Check agent logs in VS Code terminal

---

## 📊 Success Criteria

All tests PASS if:
- ✅ NO empty responses
- ✅ NO duplicate responses
- ✅ ALL restaurant data is included
- ✅ Bullet points (•) are displayed
- ✅ Bold text (**) is rendered
- ✅ Emojis are shown
- ✅ NO errors in console
