"""
Comprehensive Tests for AI Agent Conversational Flow (AI-001 to AI-006+)
Aligned with TEST_PLAN_V2.txt - FoodieExpress v4.0.0

TEST COVERAGE:
- AI-001: Basic greeting and help
- AI-002: Item search tool calling
- AI-003: Context retention
- AI-004: Graceful failure for non-existent items
- AI-005: Keyword-based routing (cuisine search)
- AI-006: Order placement explanation (not yet implemented)

NOTE: These tests mock the AI agent responses and focus on tool calling,
context management, and conversation flow validation.

# 1. Running chatbot agent service
# 2. Mock LLM responses or use test LLM
# 3. Session management for conversation state
# 4. Tool call verification mechanisms
#
# These placeholder tests document expected behavior.
# Integration with actual agent service requires additional setup.
