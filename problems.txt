EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
-----------------
This document outlines the development tasks for the FoodieExpress V4.0 upgrade. 
Version 3.0 has successfully resolved all critical security and architectural issues, 
establishing a stable, production-ready platform. Version 4.0 shifts focus from 
technical debt to high-value features that enhance user engagement, provide business 
intelligence, and streamline deployment operations.

The sprint is divided into four main strategic initiatives:
1. User Reviews & Ratings System (User Engagement)
2. Admin Dashboard Backend (Business Intelligence)
3. AI Personalization (Context-Aware Intelligence)
4. Dockerization (DevOps Excellence)

PRIORITY LEVELS:
- [HIGH]   - Essential for the V4.0 release. Must be completed.
- [MEDIUM] - Important features that enhance value. Can be deferred if time-constrained.
- [LOW]    - Quality-of-life improvements. Nice to have.

ESTIMATED TIMELINE: 4-6 weeks
TEAM: Product Manager + Senior Software Architect + Development Team

================================================================================
INITIATIVE 1: USER ENGAGEMENT - REVIEWS & RATINGS SYSTEM
================================================================================
Goal: Implement a full-featured restaurant review and rating system to increase 
user engagement and provide valuable social proof for restaurants.

Business Value: Reviews build trust, increase conversions, and provide valuable 
feedback to restaurants. Studies show 88% of consumers trust online reviews as 
much as personal recommendations.

  Problem: 
    The application lacks a database model to store user reviews and ratings. 
    Without this foundation, we cannot implement the review system.
  
  Action Required:
    1. Open `food_api/app/models.py`
    2. Define a new Beanie `Document` class named `Review` with the following fields:
       - id: str (auto-generated ObjectId)
       - user_id: str (reference to User document)
       - username: str (for display purposes, denormalized)
       - restaurant_name: str (reference to restaurant)
       - rating: int (1-5 scale, with validation)
       - comment: str (optional, max 1000 characters)
       - review_date: datetime (auto-set to current timestamp)
       - helpful_count: int (default 0, for future feature)
       - is_verified_purchase: bool (default False, for future feature)
    
    3. Open `food_api/app/schemas.py`
    4. Create Pydantic schemas:
       - `ReviewCreate`: Input schema (restaurant_name, rating, comment)
       - `ReviewOut`: Output schema (all fields including id and formatted date)
       - `ReviewUpdate`: Update schema (rating, comment only)
    
    5. Add validation:
       - Rating must be between 1 and 5
       - Comment length between 10 and 1000 characters (if provided)
       - Restaurant name must be non-empty
  
  Files to Modify:
    - food_api/app/models.py
    - food_api/app/schemas.py
  
  Acceptance Criteria:
    ‚úì Review model properly inherits from Beanie Document
    ‚úì All schemas have proper validation
    ‚úì Model can be initialized in database.py
    ‚úì No import errors or type conflicts

    3. Add post-order follow-up logic:
       - After order confirmation, wait for 1-2 conversation turns
       - Check if user is authenticated
       - If yes, proactively ask: "How was your experience with [Restaurant]? 
         Would you like to leave a quick review to help other foodies?"
       - If user agrees, guide them through the review process
       - If user declines, don't ask again in the same session

       - If user expresses satisfaction during conversation, suggest review
       - Use Gemini's natural language understanding to detect positive sentiment
  
  Files to Modify:
    - food_chatbot_agent/agent.py
  
  Acceptance Criteria:
    ‚úì Agent prompts for reviews after successful orders
    ‚úì Prompts are contextual and not annoying
    ‚úì Users can easily decline
    ‚úì Works only for authenticated users
    ‚úì Natural and conversational tone

  Action Required:
    1. Open `food_chatbot_agent/agent.py`
    2. Modify the conversation initialization flow:
       - Check if user is authenticated (token present in session)
       - If not authenticated: Standard greeting
       - If authenticated: Personalized greeting
    
    3. For authenticated users, fetch context:
       - Call `/users/me` endpoint to get username
       - Call `/orders/` endpoint with limit=1 to get most recent order
       - Call `/restaurants/{name}/reviews` to check if they've reviewed
    
    4. Generate personalized greeting using fetched data:
       Example: "Welcome back, Meet! üòä I see you last ordered from Swati Snacks 
       3 days ago. Feeling like some more delicious Indian street food, or shall 
       we explore something new today?"
    
    5. Implement greeting variations based on:
       - Time since last order (new user, returning user, loyal customer)
       - Cuisine preferences (derived from order history)
       - Review activity (engaged user, silent user)
    
    6. Update system prompt to include personalization guidelines:
       - Use username naturally in conversation
       - Reference past orders when relevant
       - Suggest similar restaurants based on history
       - Acknowledge user's preferences
  
  Files to Modify:
    - food_chatbot_agent/agent.py
  
  Acceptance Criteria:
    ‚úì Authenticated users get personalized greetings
    ‚úì Greetings reference actual user data
    ‚úì Natural and not creepy
    ‚úì Graceful fallback if API calls fail
    ‚úì Performance impact minimal (caching)

  Estimated Time: 4-5 hours

[TASK-011] [AI Agent] [MEDIUM] Implement Preference Learning
  
  Problem:
    The agent doesn't learn from user behavior. It can't make intelligent
    recommendations based on past interactions.
  
  Action Required:
    1. Create analytics functions in agent:
       - `analyze_user_preferences(user_token)`: 
         * Fetch order history
         * Extract cuisine types, price ranges, dietary patterns
         * Return preference profile
       
       - `get_similar_restaurants(preferences)`:
         * Query restaurant list
         * Filter/rank by preference match
         * Return recommendations
    
    2. Implement recommendation feature:
       - When user asks "What should I eat?" or similar
       - Agent analyzes preferences
       - Suggests restaurants with explanation:
         "Based on your love for Gujarati cuisine and preference for vegetarian 
         options, I think you'll really enjoy Rajwadu. They have excellent 
         traditional thalis!"
    
    3. Track conversation context:
       - Remember what user asked about in current session
       - Don't repeat same suggestions
       - Learn from rejections (if user says no to suggestion)
  
  Files to Modify:
    - food_chatbot_agent/agent.py
  
  Acceptance Criteria:
    ‚úì Recommendations are relevant
    ‚úì Explanations are provided
    ‚úì Learns from user feedback
    ‚úì Doesn't require explicit preference input

  Estimated Time: 6-8 hours

---

[TASK-012] [AI Agent] [MEDIUM] Add Conversation Memory
  
  Problem:
    Each conversation is independent. The agent doesn't remember what was
    discussed earlier in the session.
  
  Action Required:
    1. Implement conversation memory system:
       - Store message history in session (Redis)
       - Include last 10 messages in Gemini context
       - Implement context summarization for longer conversations
    
    2. Enable cross-message understanding:
       - "Add that to my cart" (referring to previous message)
       - "What about the other option?" (referring to alternative)
       - "Change the quantity to 3" (referring to current cart item)
    
    3. Implement conversation state machine:
       - States: browsing, ordering, reviewing, support
       - Track current state
       - Provide appropriate actions per state
  
  Files to Modify:
    - food_chatbot_agent/agent.py
  
  Acceptance Criteria:
    ‚úì Agent remembers conversation context
    ‚úì Can reference previous messages
    ‚úì Natural back-and-forth dialogue
    ‚úì State transitions are smooth

  Estimated Time: 5-6 hours

       - user_id, favorite_cuisines[], dietary_restrictions[], 
         max_price_range, preferred_restaurants[]
    
    2. Create endpoints:
       - GET /users/me/preferences
       - PUT /users/me/preferences
    
    3. Integrate with agent for more accurate recommendations
  
  Files to Modify:
    - food_api/app/models.py
    - food_api/app/main.py
    - food_api/app/schemas.py
  
  Acceptance Criteria:
    ‚úì Users can view/update preferences
    ‚úì Agent uses preferences when available
    ‚úì Privacy-respecting design

  Estimated Time: 3-4 hours

    my machine" problems.
  
  Action Required:
    1. Verify the existing `food_api/Dockerfile` or create new one
    2. Dockerfile should include:
       
       ```dockerfile
       # Use official Python runtime
       FROM python:3.11-slim
       
       # Set working directory
       WORKDIR /app
       
       # Install system dependencies
       RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
           gcc \
           && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
       
       # Copy requirements and install Python dependencies
       COPY requirements.txt .
       RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
       
       # Copy application code
       COPY . .
       
       # Expose port
       EXPOSE 8000
       
       # Set environment variables
       ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
       
       # Run the application
       CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
       ```
    
    3. Create `.dockerignore` file:
       - Exclude __pycache__, .env, *.pyc, tests/, .git/
    
    4. Create `food_api/.env.example`:
       - Document all required environment variables
       - Provide example values (not real secrets)
    
    5. Test the Docker image:
       - Build: `docker build -t foodie-api .`
       - Run: `docker run -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env foodie-api`
       - Verify all endpoints work
  
  Files to Modify/Create:
    - food_api/Dockerfile (verify/update)
